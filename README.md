# Niche Holiday Calender

## Don't Panic and Grab Your Towel, or Honey Can, or Whatever.

This is a student project for course CPSC210. It primarily 
does three things.

- Provides an overview of all days in a month and put them into
a calendar view.

- Inform the user a niche holiday is happening when it is happening. and
also provides some basic information about that niche holiday.

- Provide information of Niche Holiday about any date the user
is curious of.

This program is designed for 
- Anyone looking for some extra nicheness in their life.
- Anyone wishing to be able to provide fun facts in a party or gathering
- Anyone dedicating to celebrating a certain niche holiday but have
memory so terrible so they can't memorize those themselves.

I decide to take on this project because it is something I will need
in my life and I think it will do other people some help.
