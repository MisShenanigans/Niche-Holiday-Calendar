# H2G2 Verse of the Day

## Don't Panic and Grab Your Towel

This is a student project for course CPSC210. It primarily 
does two things. 

- Give a scripture like reference system to every line in
the novels franchise **The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy**
trilogy by Douglas Adams and allow user to navigate, 
search and read them.

- Promote and present a remarkable verse from **The 
Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy** trilogy once every 24 hour.

This program is designed for 
- Any devoted readers of Douglas Adams
- Anyone seeking hilarious wisdom in their life
- Anyone planning for a space travel but don't have a ship yet
and is currently in a panic.

I decide to take on this project because it is something I will need
in my life.
