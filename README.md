# Niche Holiday Calender

## Don't Panic and Grab Your Towel, or Honey Can, or Whatever.

This is a student project for course CPSC210. It primarily 
does three things.

- Provides an overview of all days in a month and put them into
a calendar view.

- Inform the user a niche holiday is happening when it is happening. and
also provides some basic information about that niche holiday.

- Provide information of Niche Holiday about any date the user
is curious of.

This program is designed for 
- Anyone looking for some extra nicheness in their life.
- Anyone wishing to be able to provide fun facts in a party or gathering
- Anyone dedicating to celebrating a certain niche holiday but have
memory so terrible so they can't memorize those themselves.

I decide to take on this project because it is something I will need
in my life and I think it will do other people some help.

## As a user, I would like to check if today is a niche holiday.
## As a user, I would like to go to a date and see it's month.
## As a user, I would like to go to check if a date I typed in is a niche holiday.

## As a user, I want to be able save my NicheGlossary to file, (if so I choose)
## As a user, I want to be able to load my NicheGlossary from file (if I so choose)
## As a user, I want to be able to remove a Niche Holiday from the Glossary
